# Malware Traffic Analysis

## Scope
Demonstrate IOC extraction and beaconing detection from malicious PCAPs (e.g., C2 check-ins, loader downloads, ransomware staging).

## Workflow
1. **IOC Extraction**
   - `python3 scripts/ioc_extractor.py -r <pcap> -o out/iocs`
   - Produces: `iocs.csv`, `iocs.json` with SNI, DNS, HTTP hosts, URIs, ports, and best-effort TLS fingerprints.
2. **Periodicity & Volumetry**
   - Inspect inter-arrival deltas per flow; look for stable intervals (10s, 30s, 60s).
3. **Contextualization**
   - Cross-check with TI (DDNS, newly registered domains, suspicious TLDs like `.zip`, `.top`).
4. **Pivot**
   - Enrich with host telemetry in SIEM, correlate with Snort alerts from `labs/snort-ids-ips`.

## Output (Example Fields)
- `timestamp, proto, src_ip, dst_ip, dst_port, sni, http_host, uri, dns_qry, tls_version, alpn, ja3, bytes, packets`
