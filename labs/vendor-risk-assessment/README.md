# Vendor Risk Assessment Lab

## Overview

This lab demonstrates **Vendor & Supply Chain Risk Management**, focusing on the evaluation and oversight of third-party SaaS providers.  
It highlights my ability to design **risk assessment frameworks, due diligence processes, and compensating controls** to manage third-party risk.

The lab simulates a vendor onboarding process, applying **SOC 2 reviews, security questionnaires, and POA&M tracking** to assess and mitigate risk.  
All artifacts are sanitized to remove sensitive data but preserve the structure and rigor of a real enterprise assessment.

## Tools & Methodologies

* **SOC 2 Type II** – review of security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy controls.  
* **ISO/IEC 27001 & NIST 800-171** – mapping to international standards.  
* **Vendor Security Questionnaires** – structured due diligence.  
* **POA&M Tracking** – remediation tracking for identified vendor risks.  
* **Risk Scoring** – likelihood/impact models applied to third-party findings.

## Setup & Deployment

1. Review the [vendor-evaluation-checklist.xlsx](./checklists/vendor-evaluation-checklist.xlsx) to simulate a SaaS vendor’s SOC 2 review.  
2. Apply the [vendor-risk-questionnaire.xlsx](./checklists/vendor-risk-questionnaire.xlsx) to identify gaps in controls.  
3. Document open risks in [poam-tracker.xlsx](./trackers/poam-tracker.xlsx).  
4. Review governance requirements in [vendor-risk-policy.md](./policies/vendor-risk-policy.md).  
5. See the [vendor-risk-assessment-case-study.md](./reports/vendor-risk-assessment-case-study.md) for outcomes and lessons learned.

## Artifacts

* **Vendor Evaluation Checklist** – aligned to SOC 2 & ISO 27001.  
* **Vendor Risk Questionnaire** – due diligence template.  
* **POA&M Tracker** – remediation actions with owners and timelines.  
* **Vendor Risk Policy** – governance framework.  
* **Case Study Report** – summary of risk assessment and impact.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, I was able to:

* Conduct structured **third-party SaaS security reviews**.  
* Apply international compliance frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST 800-171) to vendor oversight.  
* Develop and track **POA&Ms** for mitigating vendor risks.  
* Write and enforce a **Vendor Risk Policy** with compensating controls.  
* Present findings in a professional **executive case study** format.
