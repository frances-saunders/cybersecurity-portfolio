# Leadership Summary – 3-Year Security Roadmap

## Executive Overview
This roadmap defines the organization’s journey from a **reactive, fragmented security program** toward a **mature, optimized, and business-aligned enterprise security function** over three years.

The strategy is designed to:
* Reduce material risk exposure to ransomware, insider threats, and IP theft.
* Deliver measurable outcomes to the board and executive leadership.
* Enable scalability, resilience, and compliance for future business growth.

---

## Why This Matters
Cybersecurity is no longer a technical function; it is a **business enabler**. Without a clear roadmap:
* Investments are misaligned with business objectives.
* Risk reduction is inconsistent and hard to measure.
* The organization remains vulnerable to disruptive cyber events.

---

## Roadmap Highlights
* **Year 1 – Foundation:** Establish governance, centralize IAM, uplift SOC.
* **Year 2 – Integration:** Expand Zero Trust, mature detection and vendor oversight.
* **Year 3 – Optimization:** Drive automation, resilience, and global certifications.

---

## Executive Impact
* **Risk Reduction:** 40% fewer critical vulnerabilities in Year 1.
* **Operational Efficiency:** 50% faster detection by Year 2.
* **Resilience:** Achieve ISO 27001 certification in Year 3.
* **Board Visibility:** Continuous dashboards tying cyber risk to business value.

---

## Call to Action
Leadership must commit to:
* **Sustained investment** across all three years.
* **Cross-functional alignment** between IT, Security, and Business Units.
* **Continuous measurement** of KPIs and KRIs.

This strategy transforms security from a cost center into a **strategic differentiator**.
