# Security Maturity & Executive Strategy Lab

## Overview

This lab provides a **strategic view of security program development**, showcasing my ability to build an **executive-ready 3-year security maturity roadmap**. It demonstrates how I bridge the gap between technical operations and board-level priorities.

The lab includes:
* A **3-year phased roadmap** aligned to NIST CSF, CMMI, and ISO 27001.
* An **executive summary** tailored for leadership consumption.
* A **metrics framework** linking security KPIs/KRIs to maturity stages.
* A **sanitized executive presentation**, the type typically delivered to boards or CISOs.

## Tools & Frameworks

* NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
* CMMI Cybermaturity Levels
* ISO 27001
* Balanced Scorecard – linking security to business outcomes
* Executive communication artifacts – roadmaps, summaries, presentations

---

## Usage

1. Review the file `roadmap.md` for the 3-year strategy phases.
2. Reference `metrics-framework.md` to track progress with KPIs and KRIs.
3. Share `leadership-summary.md` with executive stakeholders.
4. Present `executive-presentation.pdf` as a board-level artifact.

## Artifacts

* 3-year roadmap – strategic plan aligned with global frameworks.
* Metrics framework – measurable outcomes and accountability.
* Executive summary – leadership-focused communication.
* Board deck – sanitized presentation artifact.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, I was able to:
* Develop a multi-year strategic roadmap that bridges technical depth and executive vision.
* Apply maturity models (NIST, CMMI, ISO) to drive structured program growth.
* Translate security initiatives into business-aligned outcomes.
* Deliver executive-ready artifacts that gain board approval and investment.
