# Security Metrics & Maturity Framework

This framework establishes **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** and **KRIs (Key Risk Indicators)** that connect security outcomes to business resilience, compliance, and board expectations. Metrics are aligned with **CMMI maturity levels, NIST CSF, and FAIR-based risk quantification**.

---

## KPI Categories

### Vulnerability Management
* % of critical vulnerabilities remediated within SLA (Target: 95% by Year 3).
* Average remediation time for critical vulns (Target: < 15 days).
* Benchmark: Industry median is 88% (Gartner 2024).

### Detection & Response
* Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) – Baseline 20 days → Target 5 days.
* Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) – Baseline 10 days → Target < 24 hours.
* % of incidents handled via automated playbooks (Target: 60%).
* KPI Owner: SOC Manager.

### Zero Trust Adoption
* % of systems under MFA enforcement (Target: 100% by Year 2).
* % of sensitive workloads under segmentation (Target: 80%).
* % of third-party integrations covered by conditional access (Target: 70%).
* KPI Owner: IAM Architect.

### Governance & Compliance
* % of business units with updated quarterly risk registers (Target: 100%).
* Number of frameworks covered by automated reporting (Target: 3+ by Year 3).
* Achievement of ISO 27001 certification in Year 3.
* KPI Owner: GRC Lead.

### Risk Quantification
* $ Value of Residual Risk – measured quarterly using FAIR model.
* % of high-risk scenarios within board-approved risk appetite.
* KPI Owner: Cyber Risk Quantification Analyst.

## Maturity Tracking (CMMI / NIST CSF)

| Capability Area        | Baseline (Year 0) | Year 1 Target | Year 2 Target | Year 3 Target |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Identity & Access       | Level 1 – Ad-hoc | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed | Level 4 – Optimized |
| SOC Operations          | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed | Level 4 – Quantified |
| Vendor Risk Management  | Level 0 – None    | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed |
| Governance & Risk       | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed | Level 4 – Continuous |
| Compliance Automation   | Level 0 – None    | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed |
| Risk Quantification     | Level 0 – None    | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Quantified |

## Key Takeaway
By combining **operational KPIs** (SOC metrics), **strategic KRIs** (board risk appetite), and **financial quantification** (FAIR), the security program becomes measurable, defensible, and aligned with business strategy. These metrics give executives the ability to monitor not just *security activity*, but *business resilience*.
