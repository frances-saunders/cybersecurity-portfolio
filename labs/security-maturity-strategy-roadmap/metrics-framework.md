# Security Metrics & Maturity Framework

This framework establishes the **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)** and **KRIs (Key Risk Indicators)** that track progress against the 3-year roadmap.

---

## KPI Categories

### Vulnerability Management
* % of critical vulnerabilities remediated within SLA (target: 95% by Year 3).
* Average time to remediate critical vulnerabilities (target: < 15 days).

### Detection & Response
* Mean Time to Detect (MTTD).
  - Baseline: 20 days → Target: 5 days (Year 2).
* Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).
  - Baseline: 10 days → Target: < 24 hours (Year 3).
* % of incidents handled with automated playbooks (target: 60%).

### Zero Trust Adoption
* % of systems with MFA enforced (target: 100% by Year 2).
* % of sensitive workloads under segmentation (target: 80% by Year 2).
* % of third-party integrations covered by conditional access (target: 70%).

### Governance & Compliance
* % of business units with risk register entries updated quarterly (target: 100%).
* # of frameworks covered by automated compliance reporting (target: 3+ by Year 3).
* ISO 27001 certification achieved by Year 3.

## Maturity Tracking (CMMI / NIST CSF)

| Capability Area        | Baseline (Year 0) | Year 1 Target | Year 2 Target | Year 3 Target |
|-------------------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Identity & Access       | Level 1 – Ad-hoc | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed | Level 4 – Optimized |
| SOC Operations          | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed | Level 4 – Quantified |
| Vendor Risk Management  | Level 0 – None    | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed |
| Governance & Risk       | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed | Level 4 – Continuous |
| Compliance Automation   | Level 0 – None    | Level 1 – Initial | Level 2 – Defined | Level 3 – Managed |

## Key Takeaway
Metrics are the bridge between **executive expectations and technical execution**. By continuously tracking KPIs and KRIs, the roadmap remains measurable, transparent, and aligned with business outcomes.
