# 3-Year Security Maturity Roadmap

This roadmap provides a phased approach to maturing enterprise security, aligned with **NIST CSF**, **CMMI**, and **ISO 27001**. It is designed to balance foundational improvements with advanced resilience, ensuring both operational impact and executive visibility.

---

## Year 1 – Foundation (Stabilize & Standardize)

**Objectives**
* Establish governance, risk, and compliance baseline.
* Centralize identity and access management.
* Improve vulnerability and patch management.
* Begin SOC uplift with tiered detections and automation.

**Key Initiatives**
* Deploy centralized IAM and enforce MFA across enterprise.
* Launch vulnerability management program with SLA-based remediation.
* Conduct enterprise-wide risk assessment against NIST CSF.
* SOC 2.0 uplift: enable correlation rules, begin automated response playbooks.

**Expected Outcomes**
* Security posture moves from **Ad-Hoc (Level 1)** to **Defined (Level 2)**.
* 30% reduction in unpatched critical vulnerabilities.
* SOC achieves consistent Tier 1/2 coverage with automation for common incidents.

## Year 2 – Integration (Enhance & Expand)

**Objectives**
* Integrate Zero Trust principles across workloads, users, and data.
* Mature threat hunting and UEBA capabilities.
* Improve vendor risk management and third-party assurance.

**Key Initiatives**
* Deploy DLP and UEBA tools integrated with SIEM.
* Implement Zero Trust segmentation across networks and cloud workloads.
* Vendor Risk Program: launch due diligence questionnaires, monitoring, and remediation tracking.
* Conduct red team vs. blue team exercises for detection validation.

**Expected Outcomes**
* Security posture moves from **Defined (Level 2)** to **Managed (Level 3)**.
* 50% faster Mean Time to Detect (MTTD).
* 70% of third parties assessed and risk-mitigated.

## Year 3 – Optimization (Resilience & Continuous Improvement)

**Objectives**
* Optimize security through automation and risk quantification.
* Align security outcomes with business resilience.
* Achieve external certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type 2).

**Key Initiatives**
* Cyber Risk Quantification framework for business alignment.
* Expand red team simulations with focus on nation-state threat emulation.
* Automate compliance reporting across frameworks (NIST, ISO, CIS).
* Formalize crisis management and enterprise resilience program.

**Expected Outcomes**
* Security posture moves from **Managed (Level 3)** to **Optimized (Level 4/5)**.
* 80% reduction in SLA breaches for vulnerability management.
* Board-level dashboards reflect risk-adjusted investment ROI.
* Enterprise achieves ISO 27001 certification.
