# 3-Year Security Maturity Roadmap

This roadmap provides a phased approach to maturing enterprise security, aligned with **NIST CSF**, **CMMI**, **ISO 27001**, and **enterprise risk management (ERM)** principles. It balances **technology, people, and process** investments with measurable business outcomes.

---

## Year 1 – Foundation (Stabilize & Standardize)

**Objectives**
* Establish governance, risk, and compliance baseline across all business units.
* Centralize identity and access management (IAM) with enforced MFA and SSO.
* Mature patch/vulnerability management tied to SLAs and risk appetite.
* Begin SOC uplift with automation for high-volume incident types.

**Key Initiatives**
* Deploy centralized IAM solution; decommission legacy auth systems.
* Launch risk-based vulnerability management program with defined SLA tiers (Critical: 15 days, High: 30 days).
* Conduct enterprise-wide risk assessment aligned with **NIST CSF** and **ISO 27005 risk methodology**.
* Expand SOC staffing to 24x7 coverage, train Tier 1 analysts, deploy first wave of SOAR playbooks.

**Budget & Staffing**
* 10% budget uplift allocated for IAM and SOC automation.
* SOC team expansion from 8 FTE → 12 FTE.
* Annual training plan for SOC analysts and IT admins on new IAM and security tools.

**Expected Outcomes**
* Security maturity improves from **Ad-Hoc (Level 1)** to **Defined (Level 2)**.
* 30% reduction in unpatched critical vulnerabilities.
* SOC handles 40% of Tier 1 incidents via automation.
* First formalized risk register integrated with enterprise risk management program.

## Year 2 – Integration (Enhance & Expand)

**Objectives**
* Implement **Zero Trust** controls across workloads, users, and data.
* Mature threat hunting and UEBA capabilities within the SOC.
* Expand vendor risk management and third-party assurance.
* Embed regulatory compliance into day-to-day operations.

**Key Initiatives**
* Roll out DLP and UEBA integrated with SIEM/SOAR.
* Apply Zero Trust segmentation for crown jewel systems and hybrid workloads.
* Vendor Risk Program: integrate continuous monitoring of suppliers with quarterly reporting to Procurement.
* Conduct red team vs. blue team exercises; report outcomes to the Audit & Risk Committee.

**Budget & Staffing**
* 15% budget uplift for Zero Trust and UEBA tooling.
* SOC and Threat Hunting team grows from 12 FTE → 18 FTE.
* Establish dedicated Vendor Risk Manager role within Security GRC.

**Expected Outcomes**
* Security maturity improves from **Defined (Level 2)** to **Managed (Level 3)**.
* MTTD reduced by 50% (20 days → 10 days).
* 70% of third parties assessed and monitored with continuous scoring.
* Business achieves compliance readiness for **GDPR** and **CCPA** audit inquiries.

## Year 3 – Optimization (Resilience & Continuous Improvement)

**Objectives**
* Optimize security through automation, cyber risk quantification, and board-level metrics.
* Institutionalize resilience across IT and business operations.
* Achieve recognized external certifications to validate maturity.

**Key Initiatives**
* Implement cyber risk quantification using **FAIR framework**; tie residual risk to business financial impact.
* Expand red team simulations to include nation-state threat emulation.
* Automate compliance mapping across NIST, ISO, and CIS controls.
* Formalize Crisis Management program; integrate tabletop exercises with business continuity plans.

**Budget & Staffing**
* 12% incremental budget increase with 40% allocated to automation.
* SOC and Threat Hunting team stabilize at 20 FTE with dedicated cyber risk quant analyst.
* Security program costs benchmarked and justified against **industry peers (Gartner/ISF data)**.

**Expected Outcomes**
* Security maturity improves from **Managed (Level 3)** to **Optimized (Level 4/5)**.
* SLA breaches for critical vulnerabilities reduced by 80%.
* Quantified risk reporting adopted by Board Audit & Risk Committee.
* Enterprise achieves **ISO 27001 certification** and demonstrates continuous improvement.
