<#
.SYNOPSIS
Simulates "impossible travel" login activity by invoking Azure CLI 
with two different IP addresses (requires VPN/proxy switch).

.DESCRIPTION
This script demonstrates how an attacker might appear to log in 
from geographically distant locations within minutes â€” a common 
indicator of credential compromise.

.NOTES
Blue Team will detect this via Sentinel KQL analytics.
