<#
.SYNOPSIS
Simulates "impossible travel" login activity by invoking Azure CLI with two different IP addresses (requires VPN/proxy switch). The user password is retrieved from an Azure Key Vault secret.

.DESCRIPTION
This script demonstrates how an attacker might appear to log in from geographically distant locations within minutes â€” a common indicator of credential compromise. Credentials are obtained from a Key Vault rather than hardcoded.

.NOTES
Blue Team will detect this via Sentinel KQL analytics.
