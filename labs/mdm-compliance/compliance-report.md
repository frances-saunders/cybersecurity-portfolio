# Device Compliance Report â€“ Before vs After MDM Policies

This report demonstrates how the Android, iOS, and Windows compliance policies improved overall security posture in the demo lab.  
Devices were enrolled in Intune with no policies applied (baseline), then re-evaluated after compliance policies were enforced.

**Result:** Applying Intune MDM policies closed critical security gaps by enforcing encryption, strong authentication (PIN + biometrics), OS version controls, and jailbreak/root detection.  
The environment moved from **45% baseline compliance** to **100% full compliance** across 2,740 devices.
