# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Security Hardening

## Problem / Challenge
The enterprise leveraged Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for application deployments, but baseline configurations left clusters exposed to misconfigurations, privilege escalation, and compliance drift. Security scans revealed risks such as weak RBAC controls, unencrypted traffic between pods, and container images without proper provenance.  

The challenge was to implement **end-to-end AKS hardening** to align with enterprise compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Kubernetes Benchmark) while maintaining developer agility.

## Role & Tools
**Role:** Cloud Admin / Security Lead  
**Tools & Technologies:** Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Policy, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Monitor, PowerShell, Bash, Terraform

## Actions Taken
1. **Design / Planning**  
   - Assessed existing AKS clusters against **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark** and NIST recommendations.  
   - Developed a hardening plan covering RBAC, network segmentation, pod security, and image compliance.  

2. **Implementation / Execution**  
   - Enforced **Azure Policy for AKS** to require authorized container registries and block privileged containers.  
   - Configured **RBAC** to ensure least-privilege access for developers and service accounts.  
   - Applied **network security controls** (NSGs, private clusters, pod-level network policies) to restrict lateral movement.  
   - Enabled **audit logging** and integrated with Azure Monitor and Defender for Cloud.  

3. **Automation / Integration**  
   - Built IaC templates with Terraform for **baseline AKS deployment + security hardening baked in**.  
   - Integrated compliance scans into CI/CD pipelines for container builds.  
   - Automated remediation using Bash/PowerShell scripts to correct noncompliant configurations.  

4. **Collaboration**  
   - Partnered with DevOps teams to embed security requirements into existing GitHub and Azure DevOps pipelines.  
   - Provided training to developers on secure container deployment practices and RBAC best practices.  

5. **Validation / Reporting**  
   - Conducted compliance scans before and after hardening to verify improvements.  
   - Built dashboards in Azure Monitor to track cluster compliance, pod security events, and policy violations.  
   - Delivered executive reports showing risk reduction aligned with CIS benchmarks.

## Results / Impact
- Hardened **10+ AKS clusters** across dev, test, and prod environments.  
- Reduced container-related compliance violations by **75%**.  
- Blocked unauthorized image deployments, ensuring only signed/trusted images could be used.  
- Improved audit readiness by aligning AKS deployments to **CIS Kubernetes Benchmark** and **NIST controls**.  
- Enhanced developer confidence by embedding guardrails into pipelines instead of relying on manual reviews.

## Artifacts (Representative Examples)
This portfolio demonstrates AKS hardening through representative examples (sanitized for NDA compliance):  
- [Network Policies and RBAC YAML](../labs/aks-hardening/README.md)  
- [Terraform Templates for Secure AKS Baseline](../labs/aks-hardening/)  
- [Custom Azure Policies for AKS](../labs/aks-hardening/policies/)  

While the portfolio highlights only a subset of controls (network, RBAC, container restrictions), the actual project covered **end-to-end hardening across identity, networking, pod security, and CI/CD integration**.

## Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates my ability to deliver **secure Kubernetes operations at enterprise scale**. Key capabilities include:  
- Applying compliance-aligned hardening (CIS, NIST, ISO 27001).  
- Embedding guardrails into AKS deployments with IaC and policy enforcement.  
- Automating remediation and integrating container compliance checks into CI/CD.  
- Bridging DevOps and security by training developers and embedding secure defaults.  

This work ensured AKS environments could operate at scale without introducing new security risks, making Kubernetes deployments both **resilient and audit-ready**.
