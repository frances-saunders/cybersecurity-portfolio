# Case Study: Continuous Compliance & Audit Readiness

## Problem / Challenge

Enterprises operating under regulatory frameworks such as **NIST 800-53, CIS Controls, and SOC 2** face ongoing challenges in maintaining compliance. Traditional point-in-time audits often result in:

* **Manual evidence collection** that is error-prone and resource intensive.
* **Delayed visibility** into compliance drift between audits.
* **Inconsistent control enforcement** across multi-cloud environments.
* **Audit fatigue** from repeated requests for the same data across frameworks.

These issues highlighted the need for a **continuous compliance-as-code approach** that provides real-time visibility and automated enforcement.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Terraform + Azure Policy** – compliance-as-code guardrails  
* **Azure Monitor Workbooks** – compliance dashboards  
* **PowerShell / Python automation** – evidence collection & reporting  
* **CIS Benchmarks, NIST SP 800-53, SOC 2** – mapped compliance frameworks  

---

## Actions Taken

### Policy Authoring & IaC Integration
* Authored **Terraform-driven Azure Policy definitions** for controls such as:
  - Enforce encryption-at-rest for all storage accounts.  
  - Restrict public network access to databases.  
  - Require approved resource tagging for audit traceability.  
* Created a **compliance baseline module** reusable across subscriptions.  

### Dashboard & Evidence Visualization
* Built **Azure Monitor Workbooks** to visualize:
  - % compliance by framework (NIST/CIS/SOC 2).  
  - Control-level pass/fail trends over time.  
  - Resource-level non-compliance drilldowns.  

### Audit Checklist Automation
* Authored an **audit-readiness checklist** tied directly to policy states.  
* Automated export of evidence (JSON/CSV) for internal and external auditors.  

### Framework Mapping
* Mapped each control to **NIST 800-53, CIS, and SOC 2** requirements.  
* Produced a **crosswalk matrix** to reduce duplication across audits.

## Results / Impact

* Transformed compliance from a **manual, point-in-time exercise** into a **continuous, automated process**.  
* Reduced evidence collection time by **~70%**, freeing engineers for higher-value work.  
* Enabled executives to see **real-time compliance scores** across frameworks.  
* Delivered a **repeatable, policy-as-code compliance baseline** applicable to all business units.  

---

## Artifacts

* **Terraform Policies** – NIST/CIS/SOC 2 aligned IaC controls.  
* **Compliance Dashboards (Workbooks)** – visualizations of real-time compliance posture.  
* **Audit Checklist** – exportable framework-aligned evidence sheet.

## Key Takeaways

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Implement **compliance-as-code** using Terraform and Azure Policy.  
* Build **executive-ready dashboards** for real-time compliance visibility.  
* Automate **audit evidence collection** to support SOC 2, CIS, and NIST audits.  
* Deliver an **enterprise compliance framework** that scales across multi-cloud environments.  

The end result was an **enterprise-grade continuous compliance model** that eliminates audit fatigue, ensures real-time visibility, and proves adherence to multiple regulatory standards simultaneously.
