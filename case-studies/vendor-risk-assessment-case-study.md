# Case Study: Vendor Risk Assessment

## Problem / Challenge

Organizations increasingly rely on third-party SaaS providers for critical services.  
While these vendors enable agility and scalability, they introduce **significant supply chain risks**:

* Inconsistent SOC 2 coverage across vendors.  
* Gaps in vendor data handling (e.g., encryption, retention).  
* Lack of continuous monitoring or attestations.  
* Limited vendor maturity in incident response.  
* Regulatory misalignment with HIPAA, GDPR, or FedRAMP baselines.  

To address this, a **structured vendor risk management process** was needed to ensure enterprise resilience.

## Tools & Methodologies

* SOC 2 Type II review  
* ISO 27001 Annex A controls mapping  
* NIST 800-171 & CMMC references  
* Vendor security questionnaires  
* POA&M (Plan of Actions & Milestones) tracking  
* Risk scoring methodology (likelihood x impact)

## Actions Taken

### Vendor Evaluation Checklist
I designed a **sanitized vendor evaluation checklist** to assess controls such as:
* Data encryption (at rest and in transit).  
* Access management (MFA, least privilege).  
* Incident response maturity.  
* Business continuity and disaster recovery readiness.  

### Vendor Risk Questionnaire
A standardized questionnaire was developed to evaluate:  
* Security governance structures.  
* Third-party dependencies.  
* Compliance certifications.  

### POA&M Tracking
For gaps identified, I implemented a **POA&M tracker** that:  
* Captures risks, remediation steps, owners, and due dates.  
* Prioritizes risks by severity (High/Medium/Low).  
* Provides transparency for leadership reporting.  

### Governance Policy
I authored a **Vendor Risk Policy** to formalize:
* Due diligence prior to vendor onboarding.  
* Continuous monitoring of high-risk vendors.  
* Compensating controls when vendor gaps cannot be closed.

## Results / Impact

* Reduced **third-party risk exposure** by identifying gaps before contract execution.  
* Increased **executive confidence** through structured assessments and reports.  
* Enabled **audit readiness** by aligning assessments to SOC 2 and ISO 27001.  
* Established a **repeatable framework** for vendor reviews, supporting long-term scalability.

## Key Takeaways

This lab highlights my ability to:  

* Perform **high-level vendor risk assessments** with international compliance mapping.  
* Translate technical and governance requirements into **executive-level risk reports**.  
* Apply **compensating controls** when vendor limitations exist.  
* Embed vendor security oversight into enterprise risk management programs.  

The end result was a **mature vendor risk assessment framework** that improved enterprise resilience, governance, and regulatory alignment.
